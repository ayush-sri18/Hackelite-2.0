# Hackelite-2.0
## More than 1 million adults are hospitalized with chest diseases, skin cancers and around 50,000 die from these two diseases every year in a country alone
## Chest X-rays and infected skin images are currently the best available method for diagnosing diseases (WHO, 2001), playing a crucial role in clinical care and epidemiological and dermatological  studies. Detecting diseases in chest X-rays and high-resolution images is a challenging task that relies on the availability of expert radiologists.
## Here, we present a model that can automatically detect certain diseases from chest X-rays and images of skin rashes and lesions at a level exceeding practicing radiologists.we have developed an algorithm based on deep Convolutional Neural Network for recognition of disease by analysing the chest X-ray and skin lesions.
### notebook_1, notebook_2, notebook_3 presents procedurial steps and notebook pneumonia_detection is final notebook having complete code.
## Now we will make skin_cancer detection and then we will deploy into web-app.
